> *Haec sententia est pura ineptias Latin*

The Chipotle Mayo Clinic is a fake healthcare organization containing simulated patient data. It serves as a playground in which we can prototype and experiment with healthcare apps for our own learning and amusement. And (if we get far enough) to demonstrate workable demos and models to patients, other clincians, administrators, and other stakeholders. 

## The Chipotle Mayo Clinic Provider App

The Chipotle Mayo Clinic Provider App is a an idealized provider facing view of what looking at and interacting with patient data as a clinician providing care could be like with modern web and software tools and well thout out design. 

This is green-field, or blue-sky thinking folks. Let your imaginations run wild. 

Use Case(s)
- We get our rusty coding skills working
- Learn FHIR (and SMART on FHIR)
- Have fun
- Prototype --> reference implementation --> real world implementation that could be deployed in a local context in order to solve some of our day-to-day woes and interoperability problems

Physicians, start hacking.
